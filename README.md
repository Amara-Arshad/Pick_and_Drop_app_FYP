**Summary**
Most of the users need a transport facility for their children. Users can search for vehicles for their  children, they can hire vehicles on monthly bases via an app online. The students are generally 
unaware of the location of the vehicles and so might have to wait for a time to catch the vehicles. This app especially provides a transportation facility for students to go to their institute. The user 
of this application can be parents of students and students themselves. There are a lot of problems occurs when parents searching transport for their children. We would like to overcome these 
problems so that everyone can commute conveniently. We have developed a solution to this problem. Develop an application for intelligent mobile devices, mainly GPS. We proposed GPS 
based vehicle tracking monitoring system in which the tracking is done by implementing maps with a GPS facility. Our main focus is to provide the parent or student with such a system which 
will for sure provide suitable transport to reduce the waiting time and will provide the student with all necessary details regarding the arrival time of the vehicle, its exact location, and the expected 
waiting time.
